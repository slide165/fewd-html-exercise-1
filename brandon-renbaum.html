     Playing <a href="http:www.guitar.com"> guitar</a> is a great hobby because it forces you to think creatively. It is like any other skill or artform, it takes practice
     and effort. People enjoy hearing music because it is an escape from their everyday lives and take sthem to a place of tranquility.</p>

     <p> There are many different types of guitars, including electric and acoustic. Big brands include Fender, Gibson, PRS, and Squire. You can't go wrong
    with a Fender guitar if you are a beginner or intermediate player</P>

    <p> I recommend taking lessons with a private instructor when first starting out in order to avoid a steep learning curve. When you know what kind of music
    you enjoy playing, you can then seek a teacher or online tutorials on a specific genre</p>

    <p> Many people try to learn their favorite songs when first starting out, which is good. I recommend learning simple blues songs, which are the basis
    of rock and roll music.</p>

    <p> My favorite guitar players include David Gilmore, <a href="https://jbonamassa.com/Joe">Joe Bonnamasa</a>, Carlos Santana.</p.
